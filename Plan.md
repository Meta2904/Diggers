<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>Diggers Beach Volleyball is a small  family local business, operating in Marakson since 2007, hoping to improve  their business by getting on the Internet. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The website should help them be more  successful by getting more customers to join because Beach volleyball is a great family sport and they are hoping that more  young people  would enjoy being part of what they offer, which is: fun, social volleyball and  competitive volleyball tournaments, socialising, licensed bar (happy hour every  day from 6-7pm), available to hire for functions &ndash; fun and fitness.</p>
<p>However the main success evaluation will be an increase in more people coming, play and watch competitions.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Diggers are targeting players of  all ages, but mostly they are 35 &ndash; 50.</p>
<p> The site's design is to appeal to a younger  audience such as high school kids and young adults.  </p>
